            I currently am a 22 year old student obtaining my Masters of Science in AI and Business Analytics at the University of South Florida. While managing this task, I 
            have also been a Business Intelligence Specialist at B & I Contractors. I also obtained my undergraduate at the University of South Florida
            in Business Analytics and Information Systems.

            I have dealt with managing Content Management Systems(CMS) in my previous role when I was working in my student role at the University of
            South Florida. However, I did not deal with the html portion nor that proficient at it. Personally, I am more of a looking into data person, however I hope after 
            this project, I can see how the CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) idea can be taken in place.

            For this project, I was given the topic of theme parks. Even though I do not have specific numerical data from theme parks. I knew that
            one measure that is important is reviews. With this stated, I recently went to Halloween Horror Nights, and I wanted to do some more research
            on theme park events such as New Years, Halloween, or Christmas. This would allow me to compare and contrast some theme parks from another. 
            One example being Universal and Disney(because I am not the biggest Disney fan.)

            For this project, since my html experience is not necessarily the best, I was able to follow the rubric to create this website. I utilized
            html code from Visual Studio Code as well as utilize CSS as a format for my pages. Then, for my analytics page I was able to extract some 
            Java code to create a visualization on theme park reviews. Overall, I think this project was a good way to get my feet into html.
